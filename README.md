## Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Sophie.

I'm a software engineer at [Ardoq](https://ardoq.com), where I work with Clojure on the backend.

I have an MSc degree from the University of Oslo, in Programming and System Architecture.

My thesis work was about automatically finding counterexamples to property-based tests in a small functional language. In particular, automatically generating counterexamples of user-defined algebraic data types from the data type definition. I was supervised by Michael Kirkedal Thomsen and Joachim Tilsted Kristensen. The project, Contra, was implemented in Haskell and you can find it [here](https://github.com/SophieBosio/contra) on GitHub.

I'm interested in coffee, natural languages, functional programming, and music -- and I'm always learning more! ðŸŒ±

If you want to stay up to date with what I'm doing, you can check out my little blog at [sophiebos.io](https://sophiebos.io).
