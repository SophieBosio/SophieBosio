### Introduction

Hi! I'm Sophie.

I'm currently a Master's student at the University of Oslo, in Programming and System Architecture. My thesis work is about using program inversion to create test input generators. I'm supervised by Michael Kirkedal Thomsen and Joachim Tilsted Kristensen.

I'm interested in coffee, natural languages, functional programming, and music -- and I'm always learning! ðŸŒ±

You can reach me via email on sabosio@uio.no or find me at the 10th floor.
