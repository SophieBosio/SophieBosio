## Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Sophie.

I'm currently a Master's student at the University of Oslo, in Programming and System Architecture. My thesis work is about using program inversion to create test input generators. I'm supervised by Michael Kirkedal Thomsen and Joachim Tilsted Kristensen.

I'm interested in coffee, natural languages, functional programming, and music -- and I'm always learning more! ðŸŒ±

If you want to stay up to date with what I'm doing, you can check out my little blog at [sophiebos.io](https//sophiebos.io).

You can reach me via email on sabosio@uio.no, or here on GitHub.
