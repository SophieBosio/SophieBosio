## Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Sophie.

I'm currently a software engineer intern at [Ardoq](https://ardoq.com) and a Master's student at the University of Oslo, in Programming and System Architecture.

My thesis work is about automatically creating test input generators for QuickCheck in Haskell. I'm supervised by Michael Kirkedal Thomsen and Joachim Tilsted Kristensen.

I'm interested in coffee, natural languages, functional programming, and music -- and I'm always learning more! ðŸŒ±

If you want to stay up to date with what I'm doing, you can check out my little blog at [sophiebos.io](https://sophiebos.io).
